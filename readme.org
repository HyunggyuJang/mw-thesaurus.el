* Merriam-Webster Thesaurus
  For more than 150 years, in print and now online, Merriam-Webster has been America's leading and most-trusted provider of language information.

  This package allows you to lookup a word and display its thesaurus definition in a nice outline format

* Configure
*** This is totally optional and you don't have to do it, but you may want to: 
  In order to use Merriam Webster API it is required to register (for free) and obtain an API Key.
  By default this package is using my own registered key, for whatever reason if you rather use your own key or the default key stops working:
  - [[https://www.dictionaryapi.com/register/index.htm][Register free account]] at Merriam-Webster's Developer Center
  - Obtain a key for Merriam-Webster Thesaurus
  - Set the variable
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq mw-thesaurus--api-key "YOUR-API-KEY")
  #+end_src

*** Spacemacs layer
Spacemacs users can easily add the package to ~dotspacemacs-additional-packages~ and start using it, or even add it to be part of a custom layer, [[https://github.com/agzam/dot-spacemacs/blob/master/layers/ag-lang-tools/packages.el#L20][see an example]].
